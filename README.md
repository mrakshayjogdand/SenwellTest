# ReactJS Project with CRUD Operations and Pagination

## Description

This project is a ReactJS application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a set of data fetched from a dummy JSON API. The application includes features such as editing item details, deleting items, and implementing custom pagination logic. The pagination dynamically adjusts the number of pages when an item is deleted.

## Features

- CRUD Operations:
  - **Create**: Add new items to the list.
  - **Read**: Display the list of items with pagination.
  - **Update**: Edit the title and price of an existing item.
  - **Delete**: Remove an item from the list.

- Edit Form:
  - Clicking the "Edit" button opens a form to modify the title and price of the selected item.

- Pagination:
  - The pagination logic adjusts the number of pages dynamically based on the number of items.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-react-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-react-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
